# CS4145 Crowd Computing Project - TU Delft
**Background**: Both human and AI systems can assist making final decisions in a wide range of applications. Itâ€™s unclear whether humans will put more trust on advice from human or advice from machine but with more evidenceâ€‹

**Research Question**: Do humans always take human advice more seriously and rely on it more often? â€‹

**Decision Task**: NLP task like question answering, misinformation detectionâ€‹

**Goal**: Design interface to collect user response given different conditions with advice / explanation for a specific task

> Instead of hosting our own system to let crowd workers perform a specific task, we use Toloka's task builder (simple `json`), so the above repositories are not of pivotal importance anymore. Instead, the data repository is a collection of sources, ranging from preprocessing to generating the task `json` files, to perform the project. Check it out below!
